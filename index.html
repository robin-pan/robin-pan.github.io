				<h3>Education and Skills</h3>
				<p>
					I am beginning the third year of Waterloo's Bachelor of Computer Science program. In my studies, I have formally studied data structures, algorithm design, object-oriented programming, 
					version control, scripting, compiler design, computer architecture and discrete mathematics.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am proficient with C and C++, as I used them often in my computer science courses and for personal projects. I have worked closely with various web development languages and frameworks 
					including Laravel PHP, AnguarJS, JQuery and Bootstrap during some of my internships as well as for personal projects.
				</p>
				</br>
				<hr>
				
				<h3>Personal</h3>
				<p>During my free time, I typically play music, work on personal projects, or watch the Ottawa Senators.</p>
				<p>
					I am an avid pianist, having studied piano and music theory intensively for 14 years. I have attended many competitions, with success in the provincial and national levels. Some achievements include: 
					being awarded with the highest mark in Canada for my RCM grade 8 exam, receiving scholarships in the provincial and national levels of the Canadian Music Competition, and winning 
					local Kiwanis competitions against undergrad music students as a 14-year-old.
				</p>
				<p>Some of my other pastimes include swimming, table tennis, and video games (particularly Super Smash Bros).

				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>This section of the website is dedicated to projects which I have worked on during my free time.</p>

				<h3>Snek</h3>
				<p>
					Based on Atari's snake, I used C++ design patterns (subject-observer, singleton) along with the Oxygine library to implement the game. Then, I transpiled the C++ code to Javascript 
					using Emscripten so that it can be embedded into the link below. This project is still in progress.

				<h3>Calculator</h3>
				<p>
					Originally, this project was a command line arithmetic calculator which I made using C++ as an OOP exercise. I then decided to add GUI, but could not find an appropriate C++ library. 
					Thus, I decided to learn C# and made both the front-end and back-end.
				</p>
				<p>
					This calculator takes an arithmetic expression in infix format, converts the input to postfix format using the Shunting-Yard algorithm, and evaluates the expression. 
					A finite state machine is used to control user inputs (ie a binary operator cannot be followed by another binary operator). The mathematical operators are set up polymorphically, 
					allowing them to be generic.

				<h3>Personal Website</h3>
				<p>My introduction to web development was through the process of making this website. This project has allowed me to take a significant step forward with my web design skills.</p>
				<p>The website is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as JQuery, and is completely responsive with mobile support.</p>
